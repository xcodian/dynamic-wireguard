The first two packets in a conversation are ALWAYS keyex_req and keyex_resp.

After this, the communication is encrypted, and any encrypted data has its first byte equal to a packet id.

Packet ID's:
    0x01 (1) [C>S] - Get Configuration 
        {
            1B  length of `user_id` = X
            XB  user_id
            32B authorization
        }
